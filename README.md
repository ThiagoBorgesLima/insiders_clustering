# Insiders Clustering

Undoubtedly the biggest and most project I've done so far, based on a problem of classifying "Insiders" customers within an existing database in an e-commerce.

The initial objective was to determine who would be a member of this particular "Insiders" group, determining the biggest and best buyers on the site.

After the first cycle, the characteristics of the Insiders group were observed, and possible ideas/suggestions were studied on what to do for each given group to approach the "Insiders" as much as possible.

In the next cycle, we used Metabase to display customer data from a local database.

In the next cycle, we deploy the entire project through AWS (Amazon), Postgres database (RDS), data updated by site professionals (Bucket S3) through a .csv, we use the processing of a machine in the cloud (R2DS ), to run the notebook with the model (Through a cronjob, with programming the execution time through Bash and using a tool called papermill ) The result of executing the notebook already sends the data to the Database (S3) Postgres , and is read through a BI tool known as Metabase.

# 1. Business Problem.

A E-commerce company wants to know who expend more money at the site, and call them "Insiders", with an objective to send promotions and coupons to maxymize their sales with this group.
They need to demonstrate who these customers are through a BI platform to improve the efficiency of service to this group by the site's employees.
